								<h3>Where tipping culture is not prevalent, don't tip.</h3>
								<p>Wednesday, January 20, 2016</p>
								Recently I came across <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/19/pf/no-tipping-reversed-bar-agricole-trou-normand/" target="_blank" style="color:blue" >this</a> article that discussed about a restaurant in the US which removed tipping entirely from its establishment. Workers (especially servers) were on board with the change initially as the restaurant owner promised a 20% increase in prices to compensate for the wage gap. However, within a year, about 70% of the formerly tipped staff had left the restaurant when they'd realized that their wage was now lower, causing the owner to ultimately reintroduce tipping.</p>

<p>Removing tipping from a system in which workers are very much reliant on it is difficult because it's hard to estimate the amount of price increase in the good/service to make up for the wage differential. Now what about a reversed situation? What would the implications be if we introduced tipping in a system that doesn't rely on tips? It's hard to imagine a scenario like that since customers would probably just not tip anyway - after all, tipping is supposed to be voluntary. Nonetheless, what we can look at are foreigners from "tipping countries" who happen to be in "non-tipping" countries (for whatever reason) but still tip anyway.</p>

<p>Let's start with an assumption (because that's what economists do): Non-tipping countries mentioned here are countries in which its people generally respond to economic incentives. Countries like Japan where tipping could be perceived as a rude gesture don't apply. Basically, for these non-tipping countries, if tips were offered, the workers are assumed to accept them. </p>  

<p>With these assumptions in place, we can dive into the implications of tipping in non-tipping countries. When you offer a worker a tip for a provided service, you're giving them additional money on top of what they're already supposed to earn. Unlike some professions in the US, they're not relying on your tip to make a decent living. It's literally extra money. What this means is that their services are overvalued. Consider this crude analogy, when companies engage in predatory pricing, they sell their goods/services at a price below marginal cost to drive out competitors so that they can capture a larger market share. Somewhat similarly but the opposite, when you tip in non-tipping countries, you pay more than the cost of the service itself to get the best service out there (words spread and soon enough if you're a regular customer, workers will know that you're the person that tips and will compete to provide you with the best service). While this seems like an innocuous gesture or even a positive one, it's actually not so simple.</p>

<p>Consider the impact of your tip on local customers. Whenever you tip the workers but locals don't, what the workers think is that you value their services more than the locals do, hence they would have more incentive to serve you first, serve you better, serve you faster. And while these workers are busy making these accommodations for you, they're neglecting other local customers. After all, it's a zero sum game. Their resources are not unlimited. Hence, negative externalities are created with the action of tipping, in this case in the form of extra wait time, sub-par services, etc that the local customers have to bear. Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner illustrates a similar scenario in their book, Superfreakonomics with the example of the car lock. They pointed out that when car owners install a car lock that is visible to people outside the car, it creates negative externalities because the lock serves as a deterrent to car theft. And when the thief decides not to steal the car with the visible lock, they will steal another car which does not have a visible lock. Hence, the negative externality manifests itself in a higher probability of other cars (without locks) being stolen.</p>

<p>When you tip in non-tipping countries, especially in developing countries that are poorer, you're abusing your position of power (monetary power) to provide something that the average local customer might not be able to afford to. What would have been equal treatment among customers has now become unequal treatment. This is not the same for tipping countries though, because tipping IS expected (even for workers whose wage doesn't really rely on it. i.e. taxi drivers), and so there is a common expectation for all customers. The value added from the tipping culture (let’s assume it’s positive) affects workers and customers on a systematic level since everyone already understands the economic incentives behind tipping - if servers provide a better service, they’re potentially rewarded with a better tip and tipping customers are potentially rewarded with better services. Hence, ideally this tipping culture creates a win-win situation for customers and servers. The idea is that incentives flow from the top (system wide) down to individuals (servers & customers). But for non-tipping countries, the direction is the other way. It’s a bottom-up approach. The only thing is that the effects don't get transferred up (because locals wouldn’t adopt it) and it becomes an individualized transaction. I would even go so far as to say that tipping, in this context, is like bribing workers. The idea of bribery is giving someone something in return for favors. How is tipping in this context any different?</p>

  
<p>Then there's also the slight annoyance that if you're out with a local and you're both provided with a service and you proceed to tip. There are two possibilities: One. The local feels bad and also tips the worker. Two. The local doesn't tip and now looks bad relative to you, the person who is giving more. It's like when someone requests for a donation to charity from you and another friend. If your friend donates but you decline, how does that shine a positive light on you? I consider the aforementioned points somewhat petty but still legitimate negative externalities.</p>

<p>In short, when you're in a country that doesn't regularly tip. Please keep your extra cash in your wallet.</p>

								<h3>Progressive taxes, fines & punishments? Yes please.</h3>
								<p>Monday, January 18, 2016</p>
								<p>Whether it's Bernie Sanders proposing <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/real-tax-reform-policies-that-sen-sanders-has-proposed/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">aggressive tax reforms</a> or Hillary Clinton advocating for the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/hillary-clinton-proposes-4-income-tax-surcharge-for-wealthy-americans-1452552083" target="_blank" style="color:blue">Buffett rule</a>, these leading democratic candidates are looking to tackle the same problem (at least on the surface) - income inequality. They have mostly talked about raising the tax rates for the rich, the super rich and the wealthy, which brings to mind some questions. What else can we do to try to bridge the income gap? What other aspects of our society can also be progressive? Is it necessarily just taxes? What about other forms of law violations?</p>

<p>Since 1921, Finland and a group of other European countries have implemented something called a day fine. According to <a href="http://www.attn.com/stories/2805/finland-traffic-tickets-proportional-income" target="_blank" style="color:blue">this</a> article, it works like this,</p>

<p>"It starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two - the resulting number is considered a reasonable amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money."</p>

<p>In short, the higher your income, the greater your corresponding punishment will be. It's like applying your income tax bracket to the infractions that you have committed, although not necessarily with the same scale. It was once <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">implemented in Ferguson</a>, but failed to gain much traction as the authorities back then were more interested in incarcerating unlawful acts. But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/01/22/what-obama-didnt-say-about-crime-and-incarceration/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">times have changed</a>, the US is now trying to move away from simply throwing every criminal into prison. So it may be the right time to consider bringing back this progressive policy.</p>

<p>Consider the crimes that are regularly perpetrated throughout the US, often times it's the rich that gets away with it (due to access to better resources) while the poor are the only ones who're actually regulated and often times abused by the law. A prime example would be <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/how-tax-evasion-is-fueling-inequality.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue">tax evasion</a>. Just within corporate taxes, the government loses $130 billion each year to tax evasion. What's problematic is this: assume that we live in a world where everyone pays their taxes, including the rich, every single one of them. Does the current tax system impose the same amount of burden to both parties? Not really, because the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/12/opinions/mccaffery-wealthy-taxes/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue">American tax system is mainly a wage tax</a>. Hence, rich Americans still have a lot of tax savings from capital gains. Now come back to reality and look at the situation in which the wealthiest Americans evade taxes by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/business/economy/for-the-wealthiest-private-tax-system-saves-them-billions.html" target="_blank" style="color:blue">moving their money offshore</a>. How wouldn't this widen the inequality gap even further?</p>

<p>Of course, implementing a day fine wouldn't reduce the inequality gap overnight, it'll probably be very gradual, especially if implemented on an incremental basis for different types of offences. For example, starting with speeding tickets, then moving on to drug abuses, tax evasion crimes etc. On one hand, there's the obvious effect of the day fines, which is the generation of financial revenue that could be redistributed to the poor. On the other hand, the progressive nature of the fines would impose a "punishment tax" on the rich, thereby increasing the cost of committing crime. With our current system, the measly fines don't mean anything to the rich and fails to serve its purpose as a deterrent. Haven't you heard of rich people with fancy sports cars speeding on the road for the thrill of it even though they know they might get a ticket? Who cares? it's only a few hundred bucks anyway. But what if they're now paying $100k for it? That's a different story. Transfer this analogy to the case of tax evasion or some other crime and we might begin to see some changes in the inequality gap.</p>

<p>Of course, progressive fines are not without its critics. One of the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/" target="_blank" style="color:blue">main concerns</a> about them was voiced by economist Casey Mulligan from the University of Chicago. He's worried that imposing day fines (for the case on speeding tickets) would create disparities in the incidence of reckless driving - more speeding in poor neighborhoods relative to rich neighborhoods. However, if we retain the current penalty level or have a slight downward adjustment and only progressively increase the fine from this point onwards, the disincentive to speed around poor neighborhoods should remain relatively stable. Unless, the increased disincentive for the rich to speed somehow created a negative externality that causes the poor to speed more, then there needs to be further adjustments to the progressiveness of the policy.</p>

<p>I haven't thought as much about how far we can take it with day fines and what the corresponding implications for the different types of crimes may be, but I think it's a good start to begin making changes in the way we treat people of different socioeconomic statuses in this country.</p>

								<h3>From Harley-Davidson to oral sex, social justice has changed the tide of market forces entirely. Or has it?</h3>
								<p>Saturday, January 16, 2016</p>
								What do Harley-Davidson and oral sex have in common? (As Freakonomics authors Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt might ask) Well, for one their market demand have both been heavily impacted by social justice. But what does social justice have to do with oral sex? According to Superfreakonomics, during the old days, prostitutes in the US could charge a high price for oral sex (different sexual acts corresponded to different prices), but not anymore in recent years. What the authors have concluded was that social attitudes toward oral sex have changed over time. Oral sex used to be perceived as a taboo, but not anymore. Hence, it made sense that prostitutes eventually lowered their price for a seemingly "normal" sexual act. This shift in mentality doesn't just apply to oral sex, but for other sex-related topics that may have also been viewed as immoral in the past. For example, the use of pornography, sex toys etc.</p>

<p>In this sense, social justice has contributed to a lot to these changes. In line with the mindset of social justice, advocates today have encouraged people to embrace their sexuality and even more so when it comes to women. The conversations about sex in the US today have opened up a lot and there's a large community who're actively participating in it and are definitely not ashamed about it. For example, these days there are porn conventions to celebrate the work of porn actors. There are also numerous startups today that focus on sexual pleasure - both for men and women. Note that the key word here is "pleasure". Any conversations in the past about sex or masturbation would have mostly been about it's health or scientific benefits, as if human beings' innate desire for sexual pleasure is disgusting.  Perhaps one could argue that social justice isn't the right word to be attributed to these changes, but regardless, I'm not going to be arguing about semantics here - the point still stands.</p>

<p>Now what about Harley-Davidson?</p>

<p>According to recent reports, Harley-Davidson has been facing losses. The younger generation aren't buying the products that the motorcycle manufacturer is selling anymore. When it comes to such an iconic brand as Harley-Davidson, people already have an idea, an image of what the company's about. The company isn't just selling motorcycles, they're selling a lifestyle, a mentality, an image to portray oneself in society. Take the action camera company GoPro for example, they're also in the same "lifestyle"-selling business, it's just that they're selling the lifestyle of adventure, of traveling and sports that definitely attract the millennial crowd. So how does Harley-Davidson relate to social justice? Young adults in the US today have a very different idea of what being "cool" means in society. For men, being cool doesn't necessarily correlate to the traditional "masculine" image anymore. There's been a decline in the number of men who think that masculinity needs to be defined by body size, muscles, huge trucks or in this case, huge motorcycles. By selling the tough biker lifestyle, Harley-Davidson is subtly defining all the values and definitions that are not shared by as many people today as compared to the past. Even though the company has tried to change its target consumers, it's doing so half-heartedly. The big motorcycles are still taking up the main displays while the smaller ones, those that might appeal more to the younger generation are kept downstairs. This reflects the company's unwillingness to change with the tide of social justice and of course, with the tide of market demand.</p>

<p>Now there's one last question. Is it always the case that social justice can impact market demand?</p>

<p>Let's look at this case with the reality TV show, "The Bachelor". For those who're unfamiliar with the show, it's basically a reality TV show about a group of women trying to win the heart of a single bachelor in hopes of finding true love. Even without elaborating further on the show, it's easy to deduce that the show is built on a lot of archaic values and themes that are the antithesis of social justice, specifically feminism. But according to this article, the ratings of the show remain high, and surprisingly, the majority of viewers are consistently women. Why is it that despite the progress in social justice, women still remain loyal fans of the show? Why is social justice not impacting the demand in the show much like the aforementioned examples?</p>

<p>One of the responses provided by the article is "escapism". Women watch the show as a way to temporarily escape from reality. Another point brought up was that some women who watch the show are taking ownership of it by pointing out the flaws in the mentality of the show on Twitter. However, this only serves to highlight something - the "offensiveness level" and hence the negative emotional reaction derived from the show is not greater than the entertainment value that it is providing to women who watch the show. They are not offended enough by the show to start a boycott, for example. Considering that the movement for gender equality preceded the movement for racial equality, it perplexes me that a show like this would be tolerated and even be welcomed by the social group (women) that the show would seem most likely to offend. It's not like these women are not aware that watching the show is directly fueling its demand and thus, perpetuating these archaic values. They are aware that keeping the show alive would affect the younger generation of children, whatever gender the child may be, regarding social status, beauty standards etc.  Or it could be that I'm simply answering my own question, in that because the strive for racial equality is a much bigger issue today than the fight for gender equality, racial issues remain a much more sensitive topic and hence would not be tolerated at all if something with racially offensive undertones was made into a reality TV show.</p>

<p>So this is the short answer - no, social justice does not always impact market demand for goods / services even when social justice evidently plays a huge role. Sometimes social justice just doesn't provide a big enough incentive to change what we deem as valuable in our lives.</p>

								<h3>Don’t back down, Angela Merkel.</h3>
								<p>Tuesday, January 12, 2016</p>
								<p>In light of recent events in Cologne, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is struggling with public security issues and public backlash against immigrant minorities in Germany. It is a crucial moment and Germany needs to power through this crisis and not back down. By this I mean that Germany shouldn’t allow this issue to affect its decision to take in asylum seekers or worse, deport them back to their homeland.</p>

<p>Considering Germany’s power and influence in the EU, a hasty or wrong move would signal the wrong message not just to German citizens but to all EU member states. It might tip countries that are already on the fence about accepting more/any refugees on the wrong side of the scale. Other countries might be inclined to think that if Germany can’t handle it, then they might not be able to handle it either. It easily allows officials who are cynical about this humanitarian effort to say, “Look, I told you accepting them would only cause problems,” Unfortunately, I don’t have to provide a concrete example of perspectives like that because it’s so widespread – from the US to Europe to many other places. This kind of attitude is so prevalent it’s disheartening. If Germany backs down now, the upshot will be the drastic reduction in the number of refugees that these countries accept in subsequent years or maybe even right now.</p>

<p>Germany needs to take this chance to show the other EU countries that accepting a large number of refugees can be done effectively and it can be beneficial to society. Of course, there will be initial hiccups, but that is to be expected.</p>


<p>What needs to be done in Germany right now isn’t to cut down on the number of refugees that they accept/are going to accept in the coming years, but to beef up security in cities. At the same time, Germany needs to push for more public education and awareness in terms of xenophobia and help the public understand the benefits of receiving the asylum seekers, especially the economic benefits. People respond relatively better when you tell them about benefits in concrete numbers.</p>

<p>Of course, these efforts need to be done alongside a stronger assimilation/integration program for arriving migrants. This is arguably what matters most right now. The effectiveness of the integration program will greatly benefit the country in many ways. For one, as refugees get accustomed to German values and culture, the crime rate would inevitably decrease. For example, refugees would be less inclined to commit petty crimes that might not have been perceived as a big deal back in their country. Next, greater assimilation would make it easier for the refugees to potentially enter the labor force, thereby contributing to the German economy. For example, if we look at neighbouring countries of Syria such as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, they have all reported a higher growth in GDP, attributed largely to the influx of refugees. It’s hard to argue that this was made possible by the similarities in language and culture between Syria and the countries that had accepted asylum seekers (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria are Arabic speaking countries; Turkey has an arabic speaking minority and would be somewhat familiar with the arabic culture). Hence, Germany should definitely look at the effects of an “assimilated culture” on the economy as incentive to provide a more effective and efficient assimilation program. This also provides stronger justification for the government when it comes to budget planning as the government is not just spending money on refugee-related programs, but the nation is also benefiting from it in the long run.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, while it’s easy for me to sit behind a screen and say, “get better integration programs!”, I do want to acknowledge the difficulty in achieving that. But really, if Germany can pull through, and I believe that it can, it will provide a great service to humanity.</p>

								<h3>Make Detroit great again. Make Detroit the automotive capital of the world once more.</h3>
								<p>Wednesday, January 6, 2016</p>

								<p>In the 1950s, when you speak of Detroit, people inevitably thought of the automotive industry.  They thought of the big three – Ford, General Motors and Chrysler – and how the automotive industry was the greatest in the US. Fast forward to approximately 60 years later and you’re left with crime and poverty as the things that come to people’s minds when they think of Detroit. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In my opinion, this is the key: self-driving cars.</p>

<p>Let me clarify. It’s not technically self-driving cars per se that can bring back Detroit’s glory days, but more so the regulation (or lack thereof) of self-driving cars in the state of Michigan that will be the deciding factor. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Unless you’ve been completely out of touch with tech news or plain conversation with a human being, chances are you’ve heard of something about the autonomous car. Whether it’s Google, Toyota, Tesla or Audi, all the big players want a slice of the cake. Hence, these companies are investing tons of money to develop and test their own versions of self-driving cars. But, they can’t just test their cars in the lab, it’s simply not realistic. They need to take it out for a spin, autonomously of course. However, up until recently, there hadn’t been much, if any regulation at all on the way self-driving cars were to maneuver on the road in the US.</p>

<p>As of today,  there are only a handful of states in the US (California, Virginia, Michigan etc) that have some form of  regulation for self-driving cars, and Michigan’s one of them. You might ask, is having regulation for autonomous car driving a good thing or a bad thing? It’s kinda both.</p>

<p>On one hand, having no regulation, as with the current status of most states in the US, self-driving car developers are assuming that it’s legal to run tests on public roads and highways, which wasn’t a problem, until some individual states decided to update their laws, inducing additional costs for the car makers. For example, in California, self-driving cars require a person to be in the driver’s seat to regain control of the car in case of emergency. This causes a setback for companies like Google as their existing cars don’t have steering wheels or brakes for user control. This not only increases the monetary cost for the car makers (which you might argue, is insignificant if it ensures better safety for the public, but these self-driving cars are by construction, safer) but also incur time costs as companies would now have to pull back all existing car models and install additional parts to the self-driving cars and make further technological tweaksto meet the regulation standards, ultimately impeding advancement in the field of self-driving technology. Therefore, companies that want to venture into autonomous car development would either have to bear this risk of patchwork updates to the regulation and make the corresponding adjustments each time or wait for regulations to show an approximately similar pattern across all US states before deciding to enter the market. When that time comes (as of now regulation for autonomous cars is moving at a very slow pace), all those firms that chose to wait would have been left far behind in the race. Obviously this gives a huge leg up to really large companies that can afford to make the former move while at the same time deters relatively smaller companies (that are still financially capable of performing R&D) from investing money into autonomous cars R&D had this problem with regulation not been there in the first place.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having too much regulation would stifle further development of self-driving cars. This is the case with Michigan. Michigan allows the testing of self-driving cars but not the operation of them, which "make Michigan the most restrictive of all states that have passed bills on AVs,". According to experts, it is simply not feasible to delegate the regulation of self-driving cars to be done on a federal level due to many technical complexities. This begs the question as to why Michigan is be holding back on its efforts to regulate and approve the operation of self-driving cars.</p>

<p>If Michigan allows not just the testing of self-driving cars, but also the operation of them, it can put the state ahead of the game. It already has the comparative advantage of having the major players of the automotive industry located in/near Detroit. All Michigan needs to do right now is to give these Detroit based companies the right incentives for them to build their own self-driving cars or to give the right incentives for other tech companies who are focused on self-driving technologies to collaborate with the Detroit automakers to manufacture the self-driving cars. This incentive can be given by loosening up regulation and allowing operation of self-driving cars in Michigan.<p>

<p>An example of the effect of less strict regulations on self-driving cars can be found in China with Google’s Chinese counterpart, Baidu that is developing their own self-driving car. Baidu predicts that within three years, their self-driving cars will be fully operational on the road while Google has a similar prediction but with a five year time frame, the additional two years due to regulation issues. However, in terms of self-driving technology, Baidu is still behind American companies like Google. Thus giving an even stronger justification as to why Michigan should definitely take advantage of this opportunity as soon as possible to revamp the automotive industry (again, companies like Google can collaborate with smaller automakers in Detroit to produce self-driving cars). At this point, it's more of a race in regulation standards than a race in technology.</p>

<p>If the regulation of self-driving cars in Michigan allows both testing and operation, it sends a signal to the other states and to the rest of the world. What Michigan would be saying is this - we're ready to take the lead once more in the automotive industry. Then all Detroit has to do is let the agglomeration effects work its magic (among other factors) to propel Detroit back to its once upon a time status as the automotive city of the world. </p>
